This site is the home for a training that takes people from Zero to Quarto.

The goal of the training is to teach engineers, researchers, or anyone else
how to use their computer a little better -- in particular, to help them
move away from Word and Excel into the land of Python, Jupyter,
Markdown, Git, and Quarto.

We want these scientists and researchers to get the benefits of
using code -- chief among which are:

- Version control and working more smoothly with colleagues and the open source community
- Publishing a website to share findings
- Using new packages and tools

The training's website is on GitHub Pages [here↗](https://gsmithapps.github.io/zero-to-quarto-site/),
and The GitHub repo that makes the site is [here↗](https://github.com/GSmithApps/zero-to-quarto-site).
