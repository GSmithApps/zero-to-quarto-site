This site is the home for a training that takes people from Zero to Quarto.

The goal of the training is to teach engineers, researchers, or anyone else
how to use their computer or write code a little better.  There are two main
groups of people we see as a fit for this:

- Engineers who work in industry and don't code much or at all.
- Researchers who do some coding or computation, but feel rusty on their
  coding or know that their coding workflows could use some improvement.

---

We want to help them do the following

- Move away from Word and Excel into Python, Jupyter,
  Markdown, Git, and Quarto.
- Streamline their workflows
- Render and publish their research in a website,
- Use modern collaboration and version control systems such as Git
  to allow working more smoothly with colleagues and the open source community
- Using new packages and tools
