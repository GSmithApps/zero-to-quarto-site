So, mine is in /Users/grantsmith.\nYou have free reign in here. You usually don’t need admin to do things here, and you can’t break things as much when operating here.\nWhen you do things above that folder is sometimes when you need admin and when you can break things.\n\n\n\n\nOneDrive Folder\n\nOftentimes IT will suggest that you work in your OneDrive folder or one of its subfolders. In this course, we won’t do that.\n\nPutting things in OneDrive can be nice because work is saved, but it can be a pain.\nOftentimes when programming, software will be installed in the folder you’re working in.
