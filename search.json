    "text": "This is about the folder structure on your computer.\n\n\nFast Facts\n\nMac and linux usually use forward slashes /. Windows uses backslashes \\.\n\nIn many programming languages (including python), the backslash is an escape character, so you have to use two backslashes \\\\ to get one.\n\n\n\nThere are two folders that are of particular importance: your user folder, and your OneDrive folder.\n\n\n\nUser Folder\n\nYour user folder is usually in /Users/&lt;your-name&gt;. So, mine is in /Users/grantsmith.\nYou have free reign in here. You usually don’t need admin to do things here, and you can’t break things as much when operating here.\nWhen you do things above that folder is sometimes when you need admin and when you can break things.\n\n\n\n\nOneDrive Folder\n\nOftentimes IT will suggest that you work in your OneDrive folder or one of its subfolders. In this course, we won’t do that.\n\nPutting things in OneDrive can be nice because work is saved, but it can be a pain.\nOftentimes when programming, software will be installed in the folder you’re working in. So if you’re working in OneDrive, it will try to upload all that software that you install, which you don’t want.",
