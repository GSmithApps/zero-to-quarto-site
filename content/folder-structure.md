This is about the folder structure on your computer.

---

# Fast Facts

- Mac and linux usually use forward slashes `/`. Windows uses backslashes `\`.
  - In many programming languages (including python), the backslash is an escape character, so you have to use two backslashes `\\` to get one.

There are two folders that are of particular importance: your user folder, and your OneDrive folder.


---

# User Folder

- Your user folder is usually in `/Users/<your-name>`. So, mine is in `/Users/grantsmith`.
- You have free reign in here. You usually don't need admin to do things here, and you can't break things as much when operating here.
- When you do things above that folder is sometimes when you need admin and when you can break things.

# OneDrive Folder

- Oftentimes IT will suggest that you work in your OneDrive folder or something within it. In this course, we mostly won't do that.
