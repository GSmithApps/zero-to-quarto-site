Here we'll learn about Quarto. 

We'll learn about how to publish jupyter notebooks as markdown files.

Quarto builds on interactive python and makes interactive markdown as well.
It flips to where the prose is the main content, and the code is secondary,
rather than in python files, code is primary, and prose is secondary.

It also builds and renders things.


```{python}
print(2+2)
```
