# File Naming Convention

Please forgive the naming convention looking weird at first.
We used this to make the files be in the order they're rendered
in the site rather than alphabetical.

We're using ***zXX.*** to control the ordering.
If you want to add a new
file somewhere in the middle, you should be able to
put it wherever without having to rename the other files.
For example, if you need to put a file between
***z00.z05.*** and ***z00.z06.***, then you can
make your new file ***z00.z05.z05.***, and it will
go between.
