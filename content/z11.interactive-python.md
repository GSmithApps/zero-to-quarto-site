Just put `# %%` to make a cell. For example:

```python
# This is a normal comment

# -------------------------------------------------------
# %% This comment makes the following into a jupyter cell
2 + 2

# -------------------------------------------------------
# %% This comment makes the following into the next cell
"Hey friends"

# -------------------------------------------------------
```

This has an advantage over Jupyter Notebooks because it is easy to version control.
