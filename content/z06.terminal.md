# Fast Facts/Cheat Sheet

- `cd` - change directory
- `ls` - list files (mac/linux... `dir` on windows)
- `pwd` - print working directory
- `.` is the current directory
- `..` is the parent directory
- On mac and linux, your user folder has a shortcut name/alias called `~`.
- Your user folder is where your terminal opens by default.
- `$` at the beginning of commands is just the prompt. So if you're reading some docs or a tutorial, and you see something like `$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)`. Just run `eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"` (leave off the initial `$`).

# Navigating Around

When you are using the terminal, you are always in a certain location in your computer's file system. You can move around using the `cd` command, and you can see where you are using the `pwd` command.

This may sound boring, but this is actually one of the fundamental things that computers do: move around and operate on the file system.
