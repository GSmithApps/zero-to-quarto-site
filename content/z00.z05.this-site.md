- It's on site called GitHub, which is like Google Drive
  mixed with a social network, and programmers use it to
  keep and share their code.
  - In GitHub, a top-level folder is called a ***repository***, or ***repo***.

# READMEs


All repos should have a README file at the top level.
It tells people what's going on in the repo.
And many people (including us) are fans
of READMEs, and encourage putting them in any folder,

In fact, one of the most famous programmers in the world
(he made GitHub), suggests that [the first thing you
should do is write a README](https://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development).

In GitHub, the README is the file that's rendered below
the list of files:
