# Goals of Markdown

- Write pretty text that can be used to make websites
  (and really anything) using plain text
  - Because it's plain text, it's easy to version
    control, and you can open it in any application.
    It is very simple and universal
- It can be rendered to look extra pretty,
  but is pretty enough even without rendering.

# Fast Facts

- Playgrounds: [Markdown Playground](https://dillinger.io/) and [dotmd editor](https://dotmd-editor.vercel.app/)
- File Extension is .md
- File Extensions in general
- Get the Cheat Sheet
- README.md
  - Is what's rendered in GitHub.
  - Is what people look for when they open a folder.
- pressing enter doesn't put a return in the rendered
  text -- you need to press enter twice.
