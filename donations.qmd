title: "Donations"
---

I recently took the trial pledge at Giving What We Can, and
I've been donating to GiveWell. Here is my first year
of donations.



```{python}
from graph_donations import Donation, graph_donations
from datetime import date

sigma = 8  # controls spread of the diffusion (in days)
padding_days = 30

# Sample data
first_donation = Donation(date(2024, 2, 15), 5181.30)
second_donation = Donation(date(2024, 9, 16), 7318.04)
third_donation = Donation(date(2024, 10, 10), 15774.05)
donations = [first_donation, second_donation, third_donation]

diffused_amounts = graph_donations(
  sigma,
  padding_days,
  donations
)
```


This plot is my donations with a diffusion kernel applied
just to smooth them out.
