This is where I'm testing learning about Quarto

As some example content to tinker with, I killed
two birds with one stone and made a page
about recent donations to GiveWell.  I wanted
to plot recent donations, and I wanted to see
if I could smooth them out over time, and I think it
worked nicely.

One remaining item I have for learning quarto is
figuring out how to publish it to github pages.
