This site is made for a course that shows people
how to use their computer a little better to go from
not knowing much programming all the way to using Python and
Quarto.

It's designed for engineers, scientists, or researchers who
might benefit from some of these things, for example,
if they've felt some pain points from things such as
spreadsheets or not being able to publish their work.

The GitHub repo that makes this site is [hereâ†—](https://github.com/GSmithApps/zero-to-quarto-site)
